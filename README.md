## Overview

This repository contains two comprehensive data science projects using MLB historical data. The projects aim to analyze managerial success and the impact of top players on team performance.

## Projects

### Project 1: Predictive Modeling for Manager Success

**Objective:** Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a manager's success based on historical MLB data.

**Features:**
- Year
- Team
- League
- Win-Loss percentage
- Pythagorean Win-Loss percentage
- Runs scored
- Runs allowed
- Attendance
- BatAge
- PAge
- Top.Player WAR

**Target:** Future success indicator (e.g., Win-Loss percentage of following seasons).

**Techniques:** Logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, or neural networks.

### Project 2: Performance Impact Analysis of Top Players on Team Success

**Objective:** Analyze and predict how the performance of top players influences overall team success.

**Features:**
- Year
- Team
- League
- Win-Loss percentage
- Runs scored
- Runs allowed
- Attendance
- Top.Player WAR

**Target:** Team success metrics (e.g., Win-Loss percentage, Playoff appearances, Attendance).

**Techniques:** Linear regression, feature importance using tree-based models, time series analysis.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Preprocessing

1. **Load and Inspect Data**
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure and content.

2. **Handle Missing Values**
   - Impute or address missing values in columns, especially `Playoffs` and `Attendance`.

3. **Data Type Conversion**
   - Ensure all columns have the appropriate data types.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features if necessary (e.g., manager tenure).

5. **Encoding Categorical Variables**
   - Convert categorical variables into a format suitable for modeling.

6. **Normalize/Standardize Data**
   - Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity.

7. **Handle Outliers**
   - Identify and manage any outliers in the dataset.

8. **Split Data**
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Visualize Data**
   - Create visualizations to understand distributions and relationships between features.

2. **Identify Key Features**
   - Explore correlations and feature importance to guide model selection.

### 3. Model Selection and Training

#### Predictive Modeling for Manager Success

1. **Choose and Train Models**
   - Select and train models using the prepared data.

2. **Evaluate Models**
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

#### Performance Impact Analysis of Top Players

1. **Choose and Train Models**
   - Select and train models to analyze player impact on team success.

2. **Evaluate Models**
   - Evaluate models using relevant metrics (e.g., R-squared, MAE).

### 4. Deployment and Visualization

1. **Create Visualizations**
   - Develop visualizations to present model results and insights effectively.

2. **Model Deployment**
   - Deploy models using tools such as Flask, Django, or Streamlit to create interactive applications.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, Plotly.
- **Model Deployment:** Flask, Django, Streamlit.
